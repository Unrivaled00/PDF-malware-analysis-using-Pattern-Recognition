# PDF-malware-analysis-using-Pattern-Recognition
Built a system that classifies PDF files as malicious or benign using Pattern Recognition, each PDF file was transformed into an image (byte plots),
features were then extracted using SIFT algorithm, then fed into 4 different Algorithms: k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Random Forest. the objective set and achieved was  to decrease the chances for type 2 error (f1-score) or false negative.
The SVM machine learning algorithm achieved the highest scores in the performance evaluation which were: 95.2/100, 97/100, 88.9/100, and 92.8/100 for accuracy,
precision, recall, and f1-score respectively.
